The dataset is huge with 479k observations so i have uploaded the sample dataset.
The dataset is mainly descriptive in nature and contains features that are all of equal importance and no single feature is more important than the other. The data is summarized in new and interesting ways to get further insights. Unsupervised learning is used on training this descriptive data and Pattern Discovery is used to identify the useful associations within the dataset.
